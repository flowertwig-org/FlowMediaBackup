FlowMediaBackup
===============

The aim of this project is to make it easier to create personal (digital) backups of your movies and series.

##It should be as easy as:##

1. Download and install program
1. Choose folder to backup to.
1. Choose subtitle and audio language.
1. Insert DVD/BlueRay into computer.
1. FlowMediaBackup will try to match the movie/serie against public domain (Searching on TheMovieDb and other sources) and name file accordingly.
5.a. If found, it will start backing up the video, audio and subtitles to your backup folder.
5.b. If not possible to find title it will allow you to choose your own name.

###Please note:###
1. Creating personal copies might not be allowed in your country/region.
1. You are using this program at your own risk.
